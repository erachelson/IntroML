# General pedagogy

Each topic is developped through an interactive notebook presenting the intuitive ideas, the theory, and the practice with example code. Theoretical and hands-on notions are interwoven to keep all trainees alert.
Corrected examples at the end of each notebook let the trainees work themselves on exercices or load the correction to see the methods in action once more.
This makes the class adapted to audiences with little Python background, but also suitable for those who want to practice by themselves.

# Computers

The trainees are encouraged to bring their own laptops with a working Anaconda distributions (Python 3).

Specific packages needed:
- numpy, scipy, scikit-learn (all included in Anaconda for instance)
- nltk (conda install nltk)
- keras (conda install keras)
- tensorflow (conda install tensorflow)
- graphviz (conda install graphviz)
